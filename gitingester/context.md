## Codebase Access Conditions

| Tool          | Default Codebase Access          | Access Conditions                                                               | Security Controls                                                |
|---------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GitIngest** | No direct access                 | Requires explicit repo analysis through local hosting                           | Private processing since hosted internally                       |
| Claude Code   | File-by-file unless authorized   | Tiered permissions system (read-only vs write) with manual approval for edits   | Command blocklist, input sanitization, session-based permissions |
| GitHub Copilot| Context-aware (active file only) | New content exclusion feature ignores specified files system-wide               | Enterprise policies via .github/copilotignore                    |
| Cursor        | Project-scoped when indexed      | Auto-indexing respects .gitignore/.cursorignore                                 | User-specific indexing with monorepo optimization controls       |


## Tool Comparison

| Aspect               | GitIngest          | Claude Code        | GitHub Copilot     | Cursor             |
|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Code Analysis**    | Structural patterns| Line-by-line       | Contextual         | Indexed context    |
| **Modification**     | Read-only          | Approval workflow  | Suggestions only   | Limited edits      |
| **Integration**      | API-based          | Terminal-centric   | IDE-native         | Editor-embedded    |
| **Data Retention**   | Internal           | 30-day transcripts | Microsoft servers  | Local/cloud hybrid |
| **Monorepo Support** | Yes                | Limited            | Partial            | Advanced controls  |


### Use cases tested & compared to Copilot

a) Docs (mermaid graphs) generation: Took me over 4x less prompts to get the better result than Copilot,
the results based on gitingest output were more accurate and detailed. Likely due to more-specified scope, less input tokens
which made AI more focused. Also saves more tokens for other stuff we can use (such as examples from other repos etc.)
for even more accuracy.

## Potential local GitIngest Use Cases

### 1. Secure Documentation Generation
- Auto-generate architecture diagrams from private repos
- Create LLM-ready training materials for internal APIs without exposing code

### 2. Compliance Automation
- Analyze code patterns across repos for license compliance
- Generate audit trails of code changes for regulatory requirements

### 3. AI Training Data Curation
- Preprocess internal codebases for fine-tuning domain-specific models
- Create sanitized datasets removing sensitive patterns before external processing

### 4. Codebase Health Monitoring
- Track architectural drift through automated dependency graphs
- Identify dead code paths using structural analysis

### 5. Developer Onboarding
- Generate interactive code walkthroughs from repo structure
- Create context-aware cheat sheets for internal frameworks

For teams using Bedrock, GitIngest could preprocess code into structured prompts for Claude models while maintaining
data governance. When combined with Cursor's selective indexing and Copilot's content exclusion, this creates layered
access controls - critical for enterprises handling sensitive IP.
